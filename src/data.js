        introduction: `The design and production of premium salt dosing systems for the food and beverage industries is our area of expertise at Radiant Process Equipments.
        Salt Dosing System. The salt dosing system is designed to add calcium and magnesium salts into the RO permeate water to adjust the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) as per 
        regulatory guidelines. This system ensures that the treated water maintains essential mineral content, especially for applications like drinking water, 
        where a certain TDS level is desirable. The system comprises the following key components: Salt Preparation Tank A dedicated tank equipped with an agitator 
        is used for the preparation of the salt solution. The agitator ensures thorough mixing of calcium and magnesium salts in water, forming a homogenous dosing solution.
        Salt Dosing Tank The prepared solution is transferred to a separate dosing tank, from which the salt is dosed into the RO permeate line.
        Dosing Pump with VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) A dosing pump is used to inject the salt solution at a controlled rate. The pump is equipped with a VFD to precisely regulate the flow as per requirement.
        TDS Meter Interlock The dosing pump operation is interlocked with a TDS meter installed in the permeate line. The TDS meter continuously monitors the TDS level of the treated water. Based on the set TDS value, the dosing pump automatically adjusts the dosing rate to maintain the desired TDS level.
        This automated dosing system ensures consistent water quality while complying with health and safety standards.`,
